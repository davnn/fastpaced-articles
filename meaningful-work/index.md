abstract: Meaningful work can be understood as activity that adds value to society. Work adds value to society when its outcomes enhance what that specific society values. This article proposes a concise definition of meaningful work grounded in societal value creation.

After reading about [Bullshit Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs), a rant about meaningless jobs, I wanted to find a concise, useful definition of meaningful work. Surprisingly, I found none that were concise and generic, which motivated this short article.

The first assumption is that meaningful work comprises activities that contribute to society.
There is not one uniform "society", but rather an aggregate of people who share a common spatial, cultural, or social context.^[See the definition of [Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society).]
Each society values different aspects of life – material, social, or environmental – and thus defines "contribution" differently.^[This perspective fundamentally differentiates work from personal endeavors: while hobbies or self-improvement may be meaningful to the individual, work gains its meaning from producing outcomes that matter beyond the self – outcomes recognized as valuable by others within a shared social context.]

Societies might value, for example:

1. *Outcomes that improve human well-being* - those directly addressing aspects of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).
2. *Outcomes that create economic value* - producing goods or services people need or want [@menghwarCreatingSharedValue2021].
3. *Outcomes that promote sustainability* - preserving or enhancing the capacity of future generations to thrive.^[The [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/) reports motivate such outcomes.]

The second assumption is that people in a society (as customers, directly or indirectly) pay for goods and services that enhance these valued aspects. 
To make this abstract notion of societal value more operational, we can borrow from lean manufacturing – a discipline that rigorously distinguishes between value-adding and wasteful activity from the customer’s perspective:

> Value can only be defined by the ultimate customer. It is only meaningful when expressed in terms of a specific product (a good, a service, or a combination) which meets the customer’s needs at a specific price and at a specific time. – [@womackLeanThinkingBanish2003]

In lean thinking, all work is categorized as either *value-added* (directly transforming a product or service in ways the customer values) or *non-value-added* (supporting or wasteful activity that does not directly add value).
Obviously, the value a product or service generates must outweigh its cost, which can be visualized as follows:

![The relationship of value, cost and waste [@hinesLearningEvolveReview2004].](value-cost-waste.png){.width-medium .themed .caption}

This diagram illustrates two ways in which work can create societal value.
First, by reducing waste, meaningful work lowers the cost of producing valuable goods or services, making them more accessible to society.
Second, by developing customer value, meaningful work enhances the usefulness of those outputs, thereby increasing their benefit to society.

In this view, these two directions - cost reduction and value enhancement - describe the full spectrum of how work can be meaningful.

> Meaningful work can be defined as work that directly adds value to society or reduces the cost of products and services that add value to society.

And now, back to my *~~bullshit~~ meaningful job*.
